# School awards and marks

Russian schools use 5-mark system from 1 to 5, where 1 means "very bad" and 5 means "excellent".

All my trimester and year marks [were 5s](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m2GbqXmX517I3rUh3la7o9sScr8xQEB_?usp=sharing) after each of the 8 completed education years.

I have several [excellent learner diplomas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14EnU_PFeORvrmkHErXvFSKSEERJa6v94?usp=sharing).

I was nominated for a "School Star" award four times in a row, from 5th to 8th grade. It is an award that is given to three people in a form. One form is about 30 students.

Have successfully completed several school projects, including [school museum database viewer](http://project.gym1505.ru/node/27354) and Android applications for education.

# A little about my programming background

I am familiar with many microcontrollers, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I've made a local system tesing server using Fedora OS.

As of programming languages, I prefer Python and C++. I can teach others Scratch and LEGO Mindstorms, including advanced algorithms.

For the last 2 years I was practicing competitive programming. According to [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/hurricanecoder?locale=en), I am currently in top-500 Moscow.

I have some another cool projects written in Python, some of them are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/https://github.com/ASMaksimov2007).
