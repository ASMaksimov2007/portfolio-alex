# A little about my programming background

I am familiar with many microcontrollers, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I've made a local system tesing server using Fedora OS.

As of programming languages, I prefer Python and C++. I can teach others Scratch and LEGO Mindstorms, including advanced algorithms.

For the last 2 years I was practicing competitive programming. According to [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/hurricanecoder), I am currently in top-500 Moscow.

I have some another cool projects written in Python, some of them are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/https://github.com/ASMaksimov2007).
